// 1. strchr(): Find the location of a character inside a string.
// 2. strcmp(): Compare two strings.
// 3. strstr(): Find the location of a string inside another string.
// 4. strcpy(): Copy one string to another.
// 5,strlen(): Find the length of a string.
// 6. strcat(): Concatenate two strings.
